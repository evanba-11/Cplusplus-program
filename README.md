# Cplusplus-program

My codeâ€™s design, is pretty simplistic. I started off creating a class called tracker first using a map to map each item to its frequency in a private member, followed by a public member that first reads the input file, declares an item and creates a loop to go through each item in the input file and then updates the map. Then I needed to write a call function in order to get the frequency of an item in which I call later on, as well as two others that will display the frequency of an item in both numbers and stars(*). To back up the accumulating data I created a function that outputs the list of items and their frequencies in numbers to the output file or in this case frequency.dat. After that it was time for the main part of the code, I displayed the options to the user and called on the above functions to make the code complete, creating a loop until the user wishes to exit.

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this course project, I developed a C++ program that reads data from a text file, performs various operations on the data, and outputs the results to another text file. The goal was to demonstrate my proficency in C++ programming and my ability to design a functional program that meets industry standards.

#What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did well in desinging my code as well as organizing it, I divided the program into smaller, more manageable components to make it easier to understand and maintain.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
There is always roome to improve, one area I can improve on is the programs security by implementing stronger input validations and error handling routines.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of the program was the input and output operations, specifically the reading and parsing of the input file. To overcome this challenge, I had to do ample amounts of research to study C++ libraries and functions that are ment to work with files. Specifically openstax was very useful.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills I learned in this project are transferable to other projects or coursework. For example, my expierence in designing a modular program will be useful in developing large-scale applications as it divdes up the code into smaller portions making it easier to understand and maintain. understanding C++ libraries and functions will also come in handy when working with other programming languages.
